# 🏥 SUMMARIZATION OF HANDWRITTEN MEDICAL TRANSCRIPT

## 📌 Project Overview
Handwritten medical documents such as prescriptions, clinical notes, and diagnostic reports are widely used in healthcare. However, variations in handwriting styles, unclear text, and unstructured formats make these documents difficult to read and process manually.

This project implements an **AI-powered Handwritten Medical Transcript Summarization System** that converts handwritten medical documents into digital text using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and generates **concise, structured summaries** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The system improves efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of medical records.
